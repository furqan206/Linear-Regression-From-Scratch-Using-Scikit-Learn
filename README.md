# Linear-Regression-From-Scratch-Using-Scikit-Learn
simple linear regression projects implementing single and multiple variable models with mse and rmse evaluation

-->Linear Regression Projects

This repository contains Python implementations of Linear Regression, covering both single-variable and multiple-variable models.

The projects focus on understanding the core concepts of linear regression, including the cost function, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), along with practical model implementation and evaluation.

-->Projects
